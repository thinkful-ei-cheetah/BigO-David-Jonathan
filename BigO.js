// 1. 
// A. O(1)
// B. O(n)

// 2. O(1) The function only takes in a single value, and only has one check

// 3. O(n^k) This function requires two levels of looping

// 4. O(n) this function iterates over each value in the array and doubles them, so it would take twice as long to complete the process if it had twice as many values

// 5.O(n) it would take twice as long to complete the process if it had twice as many values

// 6. O(n^k) for each value in the array, the function loops twice

// 7. O(n) one loop, fib sequence

// 8.O(log n) max run time is half the amount of values in the array

// 9. O(1)

// 10. O(n) prime number checker
